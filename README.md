## Terraform Titles and Lesson Numbering
The files offered here support 3 separate titles.

- [HashiCorp Certified Terraform Associate (003)](https://bit.ly/3xzLc52) - This title is an all-inclusive study resource covering all objectives in the exam, a pre-test, system set up lesson, and an exam prep and final quiz. (It's what most people learn from!)
- [Essential Terraform in AWS](https://www.informit.com/store/essential-terraform-in-aws-video-course-9780138312190#) - This title covers key concepts, configurations and resources. 
- [Terraform Core Functionality](https://www.informit.com/store/terraform-core-functionality-video-course-9780138312732) - This title dives into language specifics and usage.

The numbering of the lessons is synced to the main HashiCorp Certified Terraform Associate (003) video course. Due to this, the numbering will be different if you are learning with one of the other courses. Don't worry if you are missing something. All files are there and I have provided a table below detailing a lesson mapping that you should use in each course.
